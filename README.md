# Machine learning in R with tidymodels

## Purpose
This project is designed to introduce R users, or potential R users, to the `tidymodels` workflow for using machine learning in R. Adopting the `tidymodels` workflow for machine learning is useful because it allows the user to keep a consistent workflow while being able to "plug and play" different machine learning algorithms. 

## Requirements

It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and it is recommended to have an installation of R and RStudio on your computer or a remote desktop (e.g. Nectar environment). This tutorial will require the following packages: `tidymodels`, `tidyverse`, `vip`, `fastshap` as well as `viridis` for nice color scales. There are a few ways to install these packages, but the typical way is to use the command 'install.packages("package-name")' (e.g. 'install.packages("tiydmodels")'). It should be noted that `tidymodels` and `tidyverse` are actually a collection of packages and will also each package within the collection if needed.
