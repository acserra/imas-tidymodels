# Machine learning in R with tidymodels

## Purpose
This project is designed to introduce R users, or potential R users, to the *tidymodels* workflow for using machine learning in R. Adopting the *tidymodels* workflow for machine learning is useful because it allows the user to keep a consistent workflow while being able to "plug and play" different machine learning algorithms. 

## Requirements

It will be useful to have some basic familiarity with R and it is recommended to have an installation of R and RStudio on your computer or a remote desktop (e.g. Nectar environment), or [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). We'll be using the penguins dataset from the *palmerpenguins* package. We'll be using the *tidymodels*, *tidyverse*, *vip*, *fastshap*, *lubridate*, *janitor* and *ggcorrplot* to do data processing, modeling and machine learning. We'll need to install these packages first. An R script to do this  can be found in the "./R" folder, or the *install.pacakges()* command can be used. To follow along with the workshop tutorial, open the *imas-tidymodels.Rmd* file in your *Rstudio* or *Rstudio Cloud*, otherwise the document can be read in the *imas-tidymodels.html* file.
